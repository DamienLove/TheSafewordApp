SafeWord Delivery Notes
=======================


Last updated: 2025-10-28 (post-alert-profile rollout)

Environment Setup
-----------------
1. JDK: Temurin 17 (`C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.16.8-hotspot`)
   - Persisted: run once `setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.16.8-hotspot"`
   - Per shell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.16.8-hotspot"` then `$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"`
2. Android SDK: `platforms/android-35` (rev 3) installed; SDK 34 also present.
3. Gradle wrapper: version 8.6 (`gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.6`).
4. Kotlin 1.9.22 plugins; Android Gradle Plugin 8.3.2.

Project Structure
-----------------
- Repo root: `C:\Projects\Safeword`
- Modules:
  * `shared` — Kotlin Multiplatform domain + data (compileSdk 35)
  * `androidApp` — Android client (minSdk 26 / targetSdk 35 / compileSdk 35)

AdMob Configuration
-------------------
- Android App ID: `ca-app-pub-5327057757821609~9475449237`
- Android Native Ad (free): `ca-app-pub-5327057757821609/4853677944`
- Android Banner (reserved): `ca-app-pub-5327057757821609/8317446089`
- iOS App ID: `ca-app-pub-5327057757821609~4387785846`
- iOS Banner: `ca-app-pub-5327057757821609/9655590245`
- iOS Native: `ca-app-pub-5327057757821609/4494585296`
- `app-ads.txt` line: `google.com, pub-5327057757821609, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0`

Product Flavours
----------------
- `free` (applicationId suffix `.free`): ads enabled, Incoming Mode disabled, three-contact cap, ringer restore after 10 minutes.
- `pro` (suffix `.pro`): ads disabled, Incoming Mode enabled, unlimited contacts, ringer restore after 5 minutes.
- Runtime behaviour controlled via `BuildConfig` flags (`FEATURE_ADS_ENABLED`, `CONTACT_LIMIT`, `RINGER_RESTORE_DELAY_MINUTES`).

Build Commands
--------------
- Clean: `./gradlew.bat clean`
- Assemble free release: `./gradlew.bat androidApp:assembleFreeRelease`
- Assemble pro release: `./gradlew.bat androidApp:assembleProRelease`
- Shared module check: `./gradlew.bat shared:assemble`
- Outputs land in `androidApp/build/outputs/apk/{free|pro}/` or `.../bundle/` for AABs.

CI / Automation
---------------
- Workflow `.github/workflows/mobile-build.yml` runs on pushes/PRs targeting `main` and `develop`, building signed Android APKs plus a distributable iOS IPA.
- Android job expects repo secrets: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`.
- iOS job expects: `IOS_CERT_BASE64`, `IOS_CERT_PASSWORD`, `IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64`, `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`, `IOS_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY`, `IOS_TEAM_ID` (optional `IOS_BUNDLE_ID`, defaults to `com.safeword.app`).
- Workflow artifacts: `android-apks` (free/pro release APKs) and `ios-app-store-ipa` (`SafeWord.ipa`); job fails fast if any signing secret is missing.

Operational Notes
-----------------
- Free flavour hides incoming mode (`Incoming Mode (Pro)`) and may surface an upgrade CTA pointing to the pro SKU.
- Ringer restore delay is flavour-specific (see `build.gradle.kts`).
- Ensure privacy policy covers microphone, SMS, location, DND, ads, and ATT (for iOS).
- Room still warns about schema export; add the `androidx.room` Gradle plugin or set `exportSchema=false` if desired.
- Android release signing pulls from Gradle properties (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*`); if unset, release outputs remain unsigned with a console warning.

Publishing Checklist Snapshot
-----------------------------
- Host `app-ads.txt` on the developer domain with the line above.
- Prepare Play listings (free + paid), upload release bundles, complete Data Safety/permissions, supply assets.
- Build the iOS wrapper, integrate the iOS AdMob IDs, add ATT/consent, and prepare App Store Connect entries.

To Resume In A Fresh Terminal
-----------------------------
1. Set `JAVA_HOME` or ensure `PATH` points to Temurin 17.
2. `cd C:\Projects\Safeword`
3. Run `./gradlew.bat androidApp:assembleFreeDebug` (or `...ProDebug`).
4. If Gradle complains about SDKs, run `sdkmanager "platforms;android-35"`.

Android Emulator
----------------
- Launched AVD `Medium_Phone_API_36.1` and deployed the latest `freeDebug` build using `./gradlew androidApp:installFreeDebug`.
- Started the app via `adb shell am start -n com.safeword.free.debug/com.safeword.ui.MainActivity`; the emulator remains running for manual inspection.
- Alarm tests now display a "Silence alarm" action in the alert notification; tapping it stops playback instantly (via `AlarmSilenceReceiver`).

Onboarding Walkthrough
----------------------
- The onboarding wizard now tracks microphone, notification, core (contacts/SMS/calls/location), battery, and Do Not Disturb access with live status chips.
- Buttons request the missing runtime permissions first, then pivot to the relevant system settings once everything is granted.
- The finish button unlocks after microphone and notification access are granted; skip still jumps straight into the app when needed.

GitHub Packages & Releases
--------------------------
- Workflow `.github/workflows/mobile-build.yml` now builds on push/PR/release/dispatch.
- Debug artifacts:
  - `android-apks-debug` (free/pro APKs)
  - `shared-xcframework` (zipped XCFramework)
  - `ios-simulator-build` (zipped simulator `.app`)
- Release artifacts (triggered on GitHub release publish):
  - Signed APKs uploaded as release assets and workflow artifact `android-apks-release`
  - Signed App Store `SafeWord.ipa` attached to releases

Contact Signals & Gentle Alerts
-------------------------------
- Contact cards expose **Call**, **Message**, **Link**, **Ping**, and invite/gift actions. Linked contacts now exchange SafeWord messages through an encoded, session-based handshake:
  * Emergency/non-emergency messages stay in-app; we collect the text and wrap it inside the SafeWord payload.
  * Calls trigger the SafeWord signal first; the dialer opens only after the remote device acknowledges the alert.
  * Each signal includes GPS (when allowed) plus a unique session id; the receiver responds with an ACK so the sender knows it arrived.
- Pings still broadcast a gentle alert and show a check-in notification on the receiving device.
- Custom audio hooks: drop `androidApp/src/main/res/raw/safeword_alert.(ogg|mp3)` for sirens and `safeword_ping.(ogg|mp3)` for the gentle tone.
- Unlinked contacts expose an **Invite to SafeWord** button that sends a structured SMS; recipients with the app auto-link, everyone else sees the store link.
- SafeWord Pro users can continue to gift the upgrade directly from the contacts list whenever a linked friend is still on the Free tier.

Voice & Assistant Shortcuts
---------------------------
- Android still provides the static shortcuts/App Actions (“Start SafeWord listening”, “Run SafeWord test”). In addition, we now publish dynamic Assistant shortcuts matching the configured SafeWords; tapping or voicing the SafeWord phrase launches the encoded alert workflow (emergency vs check-in determined by which SafeWord fired).
- iOS continues donating Siri Shortcuts when listening is enabled or during test alerts; suggested phrases include “Start SafeWord” and “Run SafeWord test”.

Alert Profiles
--------------
- Emergency vs. check-in alerts are now fully configurable in Settings:
  * Choose between Siren, Gentle chime, or Silent.
  * Opt-in to boost the ringer / break through Do Not Disturb independently for each profile.
- Settings persist through the multiplatform datastore/on-device `NSUserDefaults`. Legacy `playSiren` has been migrated to the new profile structure automatically.
- Android exposes dropdown selectors and DND switches inside Settings; iOS stores the values (UI coming later).

Dashboard UI Refresh
--------------------
- Branch `ui-polish` now replaces the main dashboard scroll view with a constrained neon layout and circular listening control (`activity_main.xml`).
- New drawable assets back the glow/button/card visuals; palette tweaked in `colors.xml` and gradients updated in `bg_app.xml`.
- Listening toggle moved to the card tap handler in `MainActivity.kt`; permission handling now gates microphone/notification access and the glow visibility updates via `isVisible`.
- Safe Word wizard access is restored as a primary action tile alongside Contacts and Settings.
- Native ad card is scroll-friendly, carries a dismiss control, and no longer blocks access to dashboard actions.
- Free builds now surface an **Upgrade to SafeWord Pro** callout on the dashboard; Pro builds highlight a **Gift SafeWord Pro** prompt when linked friends remain on Free.

Signing Secrets Required
------------------------
- Android: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
- iOS: `IOS_CERT_BASE64`, `IOS_CERT_PASSWORD`, `IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64`, `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`, `IOS_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY`, `IOS_TEAM_ID`, optional `IOS_BUNDLE_ID`

Next Actions
------------
- Smoke-test the refreshed dashboard across small/large screen buckets and landscape to confirm constraints hold.
- Verify Safe Word wizard onboarding, voice permissions, and native ad placements after the UI changes.
- Populate the secrets listed above before publishing a GitHub release.
- For emulator testing, use `adb logcat` to monitor speech triggers and SMS receivers in real time.
- Supply custom audio under `androidApp/src/main/res/raw/` (`safeword_alert.*` for siren, `safeword_ping.*` for gentle pings) to brand the experience; the app falls back to system tones otherwise.
